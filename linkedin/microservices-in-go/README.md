[Course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/build-a-microservice-with-go)

# What you need to know/tooling

- Go
  - focusing on abstractions rather than the language, i.e. it's not optimised or will use proper code style.
  - Go 1.20
  - GOPATH setup

- Database
  - Postgres
  - Running in Docker locally (script available)

- Tools
  - HTTPie, not a requirement, but apparently cleaner that curl.

# Go for Microservices
- Simplicity
  - Concise, easy to read, easy to maintain
  - Rapid development cycles
- Speed
  - Quick compilation
  - Compiles to a native executable
  - Garbage collection (GC) quick
- Concurrency
  - Built for multicore processors
  - Parallel processing by default
